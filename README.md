# Welcome to (presumably) the biggest Adobe Shockwave Flash game collection on the entire internet!

I'm on a mission to preserve all the Flash games I can, as they are basically, the story of my childhood! I would much like to save every single game, if possible!
I'll get into saving animations later on. Please help out by submitting a game .swf file in the MASTER branch or by [filling the spreadsheet with the games' information!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sQErH861-m4NhLJ4jB_Az170l0me6mG_jyhRdGsmVBQ/edit?usp=sharing "Google Spreadsheet - Editing privileges"). 
Thank you in advance!

PS: The main branch is actually called MASTER, it's for organizative purposes... and definitely not because I messed up with the git...
